# Sensitivity and uncertainty propagation for MCFR

This project is a OOP code in order to generate, run and post process Sensitivity analysis from SERPENT2 in python (through the use of savio cluster however not mandatory). This also allows uncertainty propagation if grouped binary files of covariance data is pointed in the properties.json file in the template directory.

A set of example runs are available in the example jupiter notebook.

All the code is thoroughly commented, and with the example file and the master thesis report should be enough to get an overview of the code.
