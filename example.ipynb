The sensitivity is determined by the number of latent generations which is set in the template file to 15.\n",

The choice of MT can be given in a list or just as all_MT to select all the relevant ones, note however the number of MT entered in the SERPENT input doesn't correspond to the ones outputed since sum reactions such as MT=4 are made up of MT=52-91. Note the number of inactive cycles should be screened in such a way that the number of inactive= #to converge + # latent gen + buffer (i.e. 5).\n",

Sensitivity will at first run a burnup calcluation to reach the equilibrium composition by generating an instance of the burnup class and will write a restart file from which the sensitivity calculation will be done on the last step. The choice of isotopes to perturb for the sens calculation can be done manually by giving some isotopes, or by giving a number which will define how many of the most abundant isotopes will be selected, or simply with \"all\" which will select the default of the top 70 isotopes.
